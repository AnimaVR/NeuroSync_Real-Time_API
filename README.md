# NeuroSync_Real-Time_API
A collection of AI model endpoints you can run locally for a real-time audio2face system.

You will need to download the models from huggingface and put them in the correct folders (kokoro installs automatically, dont worry about that one - just do the correct pip install first)

Take note of licences, for your use case.
